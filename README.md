NeuroEdge v10 — UI-only Neon Blue

This build is the v10 UI-only release with Neon Blue button style and full responsive layout for desktop and mobile.

Run locally:
  npm install
  npm run dev

Notes:
- All premium backend integrations are intentionally mocked/omitted for UI-only deliverable.
- Buttons use neon blue outlines and fills instead of gold.
- 'More / Less' toggle is visible and spans full width on the grid.


Mock data has been added: src/data/mockData.js (users, messages, agents, marketplace, memories).
